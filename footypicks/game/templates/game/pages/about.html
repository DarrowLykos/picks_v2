                    <h2>The Game</h2>
                    <p>The Footy Picks is a score prediction game, primarily based on English Football games. Players
                        attempt to score the most points by accurately predicting football game scores. The better your
                        prediction, the more points  you score.</p>
                    <h3>Structure</h3>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-trophy"></i> Mini-League</h4>
                    <p>The Mini-League encompasses an entire season of fixtures and predictions. Players join a Mini-League
                        to participate in the Games within.</p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-ranking-star"></i> Leaderboard</h4>
                    <p>A Leaderboard is an aggregated group of Games with prizes for the best performing player over the
                        period the Leaderboard covers.</p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-dice"></i> Game</h4>
                    <p>Games are the heart of the Picks. A Game consists of multiple fixtures where players, predict the
                        outcome of those fixtures. Players score points based on the accuracy of their prediction. At the
                        end of a Gameweek, the player with the most points wins.</p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-wand-sparkles"></i> Prediction (aka Pick)</h4>
                    <p>An individual players score prediction for a specific football fixture.</p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-futbol"></i> Competition</h4>
                    <p>A football competition such as the Premier League, FA Cup, Championship, etc.</p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-shirt"></i> Team</h4>
                    <p>Football teams, like Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool, etc.</p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-futbol"></i> Fixture</h4>
                    <p>A matchup between two Teams in a Competiton. What a player will make their Prediction on.</p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-calculator"></i> Points</h4>
                    <p>What every player is trying to gain. The more accurate your Prediction, the more points you're
                        likely to gain.</p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-calculator"></i> Scoring</h4>
                    <p>Players earn points based on the accuracy of their Prediction. Points are awarded for correct
                    results (i.e. Player predicts 2-1 and final result is 1-0), correct scores (i.e. Player predicts
                    1-2 and final result is 1-2) and joker predictions earn a multiplier (i.e. Joker multiplier of x2
                    for a prediction that earns 3 points would double to 6).</p>
                    <div id="grad-thin"></div>

                <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                    <h2>How to Play</h2>
                    <p>Players select a Game to make their Predictions on. During the Game, players will be awarded
                        points for the accuracy of their picks based on many factors including the scoreline, winning team,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>See Mini-Leagues for scoring breakdowns.</p>
                    <p>Joker predictions are multiplied by that Mini-Leagues Joker Multiplier value. E.g. If a Joker
                        Multiplier is x2, then Players will double the points for that Prediction.</p>
                    <p>Each game charges a fee to play (See Mini-League pages for Â£). This fee is then split between the
                        Game and any Leaderboards that it is a part of.</p>
                    <p>Different Leaderboards and Games award different levels of prizes to different numbers of players
                        . See the Leaderboard/Game pages for a breakdown of Prizes.</p>
                    <p>Players may participate in any Game where they are a part of the Mini-League. They can make
                        predictions on any fixture that hasn't started yet. Picks made after a fixture has started will be
                        voided and not count towards that Players points tally.</p>
                    <p>The final scoreline for fixtures wil be after 90 minutes for standard matches. For knockout games
                        it will be the result after 120 minutes. Fixtures that go to penalties will be chalked up as a draw
                        .</p>
                    <p>Postponed fixtures will simply award zero points to all Players in that Gameweek. There will not
                        be any retrospective points awarded when the fixture is eventually played.</p>
                    <p>Each Game/Leaderboard has its own Prize structure. In the event of ties, Players will split the
                        difference between them. E.g. A Game pays 60/40 to 1st and 2nd, two players tied for 1st place will
                        receive 50% each of the pot. The player in 3rd will receive nothing. If three players were tied,
                        then they would receive 1/3 of the pot each. And so on.</p>
                    <p>On the rare occasion where split pots result in a fraction of a penny. Some manual rounding will
                        be applied and the leftover will be rolled into a future pot.</p>
                    <p>Players must keep up with payments and stay in credit. Going into arrears will result in voided
                        Predictions and eventual booting from the Footy Picks.</p>
                    <p>Go to your Player profile to check your balance and request payments/notify of incoming payments.
                        Notification of payments will sit as pending until we acknowledge receipt. Request for payments
                        will sit as pending until we make the payment.</p>
